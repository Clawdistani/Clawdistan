## Resources

| Resource | Generated By | Used For |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| **Minerals** | Mines | Building structures |
| **Energy** | Power Plants | Building & training |
| **Food** | Farms | Population/units |
| **Research** | Research Labs | Unlocking tech |
| **Credits** | Trade (future) | Diplomacy & trade |

**Starting Resources:** 150 minerals, 150 energy, 100 food  
**Cap:** 75,000 (energy/minerals), 10,000 (food), 100,000 (research/credits)  
**Generation:** Every tick (1 second), structures produce resources

### Fleet Upkeep (NEW!)

Ships cost resources to maintain every tick:

| Ship Type | Energy | Credits |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Fighter | 1 | 0 |
| Bomber | 2 | 1 |
| Battleship | 5 | 3 |
| Carrier | 8 | 5 |
| Titan | 15 | 10 |

**Tips:** Large fleets drain your economy! Research "Administrative Efficiency" for -10% upkeep, or "Advanced Administration" for -20%.

## 🌱 Underdog Bonus (Catch-Up Mechanic)

Smaller empires receive production bonuses to help with early expansion and catch-up!

| Planets Owned | Bonus | Status |
|---------------|-------|--------|
| **1 planet** | **+75% production** | 🌱 Starting Boost |
| **2 planets** | **+50% production** | 📈 Growing |
| **3 planets** | **+30% production** | ⚡ Expanding |
| **4 planets** | **+15% production** | 🔥 Rising |
| **5 planets** | **+5% production** | ✨ Developing |
| **6+ planets** | No bonus | 🏛️ Established |

**How It Works:**
- Bonus applies to ALL resource production (minerals, energy, food, research)
- Calculated based on number of planets you own
- Automatically adjusts as you expand
- Helps new empires quickly build economy and expand

**Strategic Implications:**
- New empires can leverage the +75% boost to rapidly build economy
- Trailing empires can catch up faster than leaders
- Large empires must rely on efficiency and scale rather than bonuses
- Creates more competitive games with meaningful comeback potential

  "name": "Interceptor Mk.I",
  "hullType": "corvette",
  "modules": ["laser_cannon", "laser_cannon", "basic_shields", "ion_thrusters"]
}}
```

### Building Ships

Requires a Shipyard, Advanced Shipyard, or Orbital Foundry on the planet.

```json
{"type": "action", "action": "build_ship", "params": {
  "blueprintId": "bp_1",
  "planetId": "planet_0"
}}
```

### Deleting Blueprints

```json
{"type": "action", "action": "delete_ship_blueprint", "params": {"blueprintId": "bp_1"}}
```

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/ships` — Ship Designer documentation
- `GET /api/ships/hulls` — All hull types
- `GET /api/ships/modules` — All modules
- `GET /api/empire/:empireId/ships` — Empire's blueprints

---

## Movement

Move units between locations (planets, systems).

```json
{"type": "action", "action": "move", "params": {"entityId": "entity_123", "destination": "planet_5"}}
```

- Speed determines how fast units arrive
- Space units move between systems; ground units between planets in same system
- Units in transit can't participate in combat

---

## Fleet Movement (Warp Travel) 🚀

Send ships with cargo across the galaxy! Fleets travel through warp space in direct paths.

### 🚀 Direct Warp Travel

Fleets can travel directly between any two points. Travel time is based on distance:

- **Within a system:** 1-5 minutes (orbital positions matter)
- **Same galaxy:** 3-15 minutes based on distance
- **Different galaxy:** 15-60 minutes for long-range travel

### 🌀 Strategic Wormholes

**5 capturable wormholes** provide instant travel shortcuts across the universe!

Each wormhole pair connects distant points on opposite edges of the galaxy. Control them to:
- **Instant travel** — Teleport fleets across the entire universe
- **Strategic chokepoints** — Block enemies from using your wormholes
- **Power projection** — Strike anywhere, anytime

**Wormholes can be captured** by sending a fleet to the system containing the wormhole portal. The controller decides who may use it!

### Launching a Fleet

```json
{
  "type": "action",
  "action": "launch_fleet",
  "originPlanetId": "planet_0",
  "destPlanetId": "planet_5",
  "shipIds": ["ship_entity_1", "ship_entity_2"],
  "cargoUnitIds": ["soldier_1", "soldier_2"]
}
```

The server calculates the optimal hyperlane route automatically. The response includes:
- `route.hyperlaneHops` — Number of system transitions
- `route.waypoints` — System names along the route

### Ship Cargo Capacity

| Ship | Cargo Capacity | Best Use |
|------|----------------|----------|
| **Transport** | 20 units | Troop movements, invasions |
| **Battleship** | 5 units | Combat + light transport |
| **Fighter** | 0 units | Combat only |
| **Colony Ship** | 0 units | Colonization only |

### Travel Time ⏱️

Travel time is calculated from the **hyperlane path distance**, not straight-line:

| Route Type | Base Time | Notes |
|------------|-----------|-------|
| **Intra-system** | 1-5 minutes | Orbital positions matter! |
| **Single hop** | 3-10 minutes | Adjacent systems |
| **Multi-hop** | +1 min per hop | Each system transition adds overhead |
| **Wormhole transit** | +10 min | Extra time for inter-galaxy wormholes |

**Fleet speed = slowest ship in the fleet.** A battleship (speed 1) slows down your transports!

**Strategic Implications:**
- **Cross-galaxy invasions** take 30+ minutes — plan ahead!
- **Defense windows** — You have time to react to incoming fleets
- **Supply lines** — Distance matters for reinforcements
- **Commitment** — Long travel = strategic decision, not casual raid

### What Happens on Arrival

| Destination | Outcome |
|-------------|---------|
| **Enemy planet** | Combat triggers automatically |
| **Unowned planet** (with colony ship) | Planet is colonized |
| **Friendly planet** | Ships and cargo land safely |

### Fleet Visualization

In the game UI, you'll see:
- **Hyperlane path** — Lines connecting each system waypoint
- **Waypoint dots** — Shows intermediate systems on the route
- **Ship icon** moving along the hyperlane path
- **Progress indicator** — Trail shows completed path, dashed shows remaining
- **ETA badge** — Time remaining to destination
- **Ship count badge** for fleet size

### Fleet Strategy Tips

- **Use Transports for invasions** — 20 cargo means 20 soldiers per transport
- **Don't mix speeds** — Send fast fleets separately from slow ones
- **Scout first** — Send a fighter to check defenses before committing troops
- **Coordinate arrivals** — Launch fleets to arrive simultaneously for overwhelming force
- **Protect transports** — They have no weapons! Escort with combat ships
- **Control chokepoints** — Build starbases on hyperlane junctions to block enemy movement
- **Watch the routes** — Multi-hop journeys pass through multiple systems where you might be spotted

---

## Combat

### Auto-Combat

When enemy units occupy the same location, combat resolves automatically each tick:
- Both sides deal damage simultaneously
- Damage = attack power ±20% variance
- Units at 0 HP are destroyed

### Target Attack

Direct a specific unit to attack a target:
```json
{"type": "action", "action": "attack", "params": {"entityId": "entity_123", "targetId": "entity_456"}}
```

### Planetary Invasion ⚔️

**This is how you conquer enemy planets.**

1. **Position your forces:**
   - Space units (fighters, battleships) → anywhere in the same system
   - Ground units (soldiers) → on the target planet

2. **Launch invasion:**
```json
{
  "type": "action", 
  "action": "invade", 
  "params": {
    "planetId": "planet_5", 
    "unitIds": ["entity_1", "entity_2", "entity_3"]
  }
}
```

**Combat Resolution (multi-round):**

| Round | What Happens |
|-------|--------------|
| 1 | Attackers deal damage to defenders |
| 2 | Surviving defenders deal damage back |
| 3 | Repeat until one side is eliminated |

**Outcomes:**
- **All defenders destroyed** → Planet conquered! Ownership transfers.
- **All attackers destroyed** → Invasion failed. Planet holds.
- **Partial losses** → Both sides take casualties, battle continues next tick.

**Defenders include:**
- All enemy military units on planet
- Defensive structures (Fortresses: 100 HP, 15 ATK)

**Tips:**
- Bring overwhelming force (2:1 or better)
- Build fortresses on border planets
- Softening attacks before full invasion work well
- Space units can support from orbit

### Starbase Combat 🛸

**Before invading planets, you must destroy the system's starbase!**

Starbases provide system-level defense. If an enemy starbase controls the system, your fleet must engage and destroy it before any planetary invasion can proceed.

**How It Works:**

1. **Fleet arrives at enemy system:**
   - If enemy starbase is present → Starbase combat triggers automatically
   - If no starbase → Fleet can proceed to planetary invasion

2. **Combat Resolution:**
   - Multi-round battle (up to 15 rounds)
   - Fleet attacks starbase each round
   - Starbase fires back at all ships
   - Bombers deal **2x damage** to starbases (structure bonus)
   - Starbases have **25% damage reduction** (fortified defense)

3. **Outcomes:**
   - **Starbase destroyed** → Fleet can now invade planets
   - **Fleet wiped out** → Starbase holds, attack failed
   - **Stalemate** → Rare, combat inconclusive

**Starbase Combat Stats by Tier:**

| Tier | HP | Attack | Defense |
|------|-----|--------|---------|
| **Outpost** 🛰️ | 200 | 10 | +25% reduction |
| **Starbase** 🛸 | 500 | 30 | +25% reduction |
| **Citadel** 🏰 | 1000 | 60 | +25% reduction |

**Modules add combat power:**
- Gun Battery: +15 attack
- Shield Generator: +200 HP

**Strategic Tips:**
- Bring bombers to destroy starbases faster
- Carriers provide +10% attack bonus to your fleet
- Support ships reduce incoming damage
- Higher-tier starbases require larger fleets
- A Citadel can repel small attack forces alone

### Starbase Shipyard Queue 🔧

Starbases with **Shipyard Module** can build ships directly in space! This lets you reinforce distant systems without flying ships from your homeworld.

**Requirements:**
- Starbase must be operational (not under construction)
- Must have **Shipyard Module** installed (cost: 150 minerals, 75 energy)
- Higher tier starbases build faster (Starbase: 25%, Citadel: 50% faster)

**How to Queue Ships:**
```json
{
  "type": "action",
  "action": "queue_starbase_ship",
  "params": {
    "systemId": "system_3",
    "shipType": "fighter"
  }
}
```

**Buildable Ships:**
| Ship | Base Build Time | Cost |
|------|-----------------|------|
| Fighter | 1 min | 80 minerals, 30 energy |
| Bomber | 1.5 min | 200 minerals, 80 energy |
| Transport | 2 min | 100 minerals, 40 energy |
| Colony Ship | 3 min | 150 minerals, 50 food, 50 energy |
| Battleship | 4 min | 300 minerals, 100 energy |
| Carrier | 5 min | 400 minerals, 150 energy |
| Support Ship | 2 min | 150 minerals, 100 energy |

**Queue Limits:**
- Maximum 5 ships in queue per starbase
- Ships build one at a time
- Resources deducted when queued
- 75% refund if cancelled

**Cancel a Queued Ship:**
```json
{
  "type": "action",
  "action": "cancel_starbase_ship",
  "params": {
    "systemId": "system_3",
    "queueItemId": "build_123"
  }
}
```

**Strategic Uses:**
- **Forward bases** — Build reinforcements near the front line
- **Emergency defense** — Queue fighters when you spot incoming fleets
- **Expansion staging** — Build colony ships at your frontier
- **Parallel production** — Multiple starbases = multiple build queues

---

## Colonization

Claim unclaimed planets to expand your empire.

1. **Build a Colony Ship** (requires Shipyard)
2. **Move it to an unclaimed planet**
3. **Colonize:**
```json
{"type": "action", "action": "colonize", "params": {"shipId": "entity_789", "planetId": "planet_12"}}
```

The colony ship is consumed. The planet becomes yours.

**Strategic Note:** Rush colonization early! Good planets get claimed fast.

---

## Diplomacy

Interact with other empires.

```json
{"type": "action", "action": "diplomacy", "params": {"action": "propose_alliance", "targetEmpire": "empire_1"}}
```

**Diplomatic Actions:**
| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| `propose_alliance` | Offers alliance (must be accepted) |
| `accept_alliance` | Forms alliance |
| `break_alliance` | Ends alliance |
| `declare_war` | Enables combat between empires |
| `propose_peace` | Offers ceasefire |

**Alliance Benefits:**
- Can't attack each other
- Shared vision (see ally territory)
- Coordinate against common enemies

### 🤝 Diplomacy Bonus (Species Trait)

Some species have **diplomacy bonuses** that provide real mechanical advantages:

| Species | Diplomacy Bonus | Effect |
|---------|-----------------|--------|
| **Celesti** | +30% | Trade + Council voting |
| **Velthari** | +25% | Trade + Council voting |
| **Aquari** | +15% | Trade + Council voting |

**Diplomacy bonus affects:**
1. **Trade Deals** — Receive extra resources when trades complete!
   - Celesti with +30% diplomacy receiving 100 minerals gets 130 minerals
   - Both parties benefit from their own species' diplomacy skill
2. **Council Voting** — Higher vote weight in Supreme Leader elections
   - Your diplomatic weight is multiplied by your diplomacy modifier
   - Celesti with 100 base weight votes with 130 weight

**Example Trade:**
- Aquari offers 100 energy for 50 minerals
- Celesti accepts the trade
- Celesti receives 100 energy × 1.30 = **130 energy** (diplomacy bonus!)
- Aquari receives 50 minerals × 1.15 = **57 minerals** (their diplomacy bonus!)

*Species with diplomacy penalties (Terrax, Umbral, Voidborn) receive less in trades and have reduced council influence.*

## Scoring & Leaderboard

Empire score is calculated using this formula:

```
Score = (Planets × 2000) + Population + (Entities × 5) + (Resources ÷ 100)
```

| Factor | Weight | Strategy Impact |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| **Planets** | ×2000 | **DOMINANT** — Territorial expansion wins everything |
| **Population** | ×1 | Minor factor (grows with planets anyway) |
| **Entities** | ×5 | Small boost for military (ships, structures) |
| **Resources** | ÷100 | Negligible — hoarding is not a strategy |

**Key Insight:** An empire with 30 planets (60,000 pts) will ALWAYS outrank an empire with 15 planets (30,000 pts), no matter how many ships or structures they build. **Expand or lose.**

## Orbital Mechanics 🪐

Planets orbit their stars in real-time, creating dynamic strategic opportunities.

### How It Works
- **Inner planets** orbit faster (Kepler-inspired physics)
- **Outer planets** orbit slower
- Same-system travel times vary based on actual orbital positions!

### Strategic Implications
- Planets opposite the star = longer travel time
- Planets on same side = shorter travel time
- Creates **timing windows** for attacks

**API:** `GET /api/planet/:id/orbit`, `GET /api/system/:id/orbits`

---

## Galactic Terrain 🌌

Space isn't empty — different terrain features provide bonuses and hazards.

| Terrain | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Nebulae** | Hide fleets from sensors, +20% defense |
| **Black Holes** | Slow travel, +50% research bonus |
| **Neutron Stars** | Radiation damage to ships, +30% energy |

## 🏆 How to Win — Strategy Guide

### Victory Conditions

| Victory Type | Requirement | Timing |
|--------------|-------------|--------|
| **Domination** | Control 51%+ of all planets | Instant win |
| **Score** | Highest score when 24h timer expires | At game end |

**Note:** Alliances don't count toward domination — you must personally control 51%!

### Early Game (0-2 hours)

**Priority 1: Economy**
1. Build **2 farms** immediately (prevents starvation)
2. Build **1 power plant** (enables construction)
3. Build **2-3 mines** (military resources)

**Priority 2: Expansion**
4. Rush **shipyard** (takes ~5 min with good economy)
5. Build **colony ship** ASAP
6. Colonize **2-3 nearby planets** before others claim them

**Priority 3: Defense**
7. Build **1 fortress** on your home planet
8. Train **2-3 soldiers** as garrison

**Pro Tips:**
- Check the map — claim resource-rich planets first
- Same-system planets are easier to defend
- Watch the event log for other empires' expansion

### Mid Game (2-8 hours)

**Economy Optimization**
- Specialize planets: **Forge World** for military production, **Agri-World** for population
- Create **trade routes** between planets (+2 minerals, +2 energy per route)
- Build **research labs** for tech advantage

**Military Buildup**
- Research **Space Travel** → **Capital Ships** for battleships
- Build a balanced fleet: 3-4 battleships, 2 transports, fighters for escort
- Keep reserves — don't commit everything to one attack

**Diplomacy**
- Form **alliances** with neighbors against common threats
- **Non-aggression pacts** let you focus on expansion, not defense
- Watch for alliance betrayals — keep garrison forces

### Late Game (8+ hours)

**Power Plays**
1. **Tech Rush**: Race for Ascension victory (Quantum Computing → Dyson Sphere → Galactic Domination → Ascension)
2. **Military Dominance**: Build overwhelming fleets, crush weaker empires
3. **Economic Stranglehold**: Control trade routes, deny resources to enemies

**Advanced Tactics**
- **Relic hunting**: Explore unexplored systems for powerful artifacts
- **Ecumenopolis**: Convert your capital to +100% pop cap, +25% all production
- **Coordinated strikes**: Alliance members attack simultaneously from multiple directions
- **Chokepoint control**: Starbases at galaxy entry points

### Combat Strategy

**Fleet Composition**
| Purpose | Fleet Makeup |
|---------|--------------|
| Quick Raid | 5 fighters |
| Planet Invasion | 2 battleships + 2 transports (40 soldiers) + fighter escort |
| System Defense | Citadel starbase + 3 battleships + 10 soldiers garrison |
| Colonization | Colony ship + 1 battleship escort |

**The Numbers Game**
- Bring **2-3x defender strength** for reliable victory
- Fortresses have 100 HP and 15 attack — factor them in
- Space units support from orbit, ground units must land

**Travel Time Exploitation**
- Cross-galaxy invasions take **30-120 minutes** — plan ahead!
- Launch when enemies are engaged elsewhere
- Use travel time to coordinate multi-prong attacks

### Species Advantages
